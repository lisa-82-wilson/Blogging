      <h2>Where do you garden?</h2>

      <p>Do you grow plants inside by the windows?<p>

      <p>This is often a good place to put plants, most plants thrive here.<p>

      <p>Do you utilize your community garden?
        This is a nice way to become more connected within your community.
      <p>This is often a nice way to share outside space without having to plan your own garden. <p>

  <h2>Do you have a favorite plant?</h2>

    <p>Does gardening remind you of someone?<p>

    <p>I often plant things that were my family or friend's favorite flower.  I feel connected to them by growing what they <em>love</em>.  There are different family favorites and it is a good way to start a new family tradition.


      <p>Do you garden with family or by yourself?
      <p>I try to include my son in the gardening and it's often trial and error.  Fun in the sun is our goal.

  It's now fall and there are lot of trees with fruit on them. There are gleaning groups on Facebook, or you can check in with your local food bank for information.

  Look at what the Farmer's Almanac suggests for using up the crisp fall apples.
