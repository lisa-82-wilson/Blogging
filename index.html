      <h2>Where do you garden?</h2>

      <p>Do you grow plants inside by the windows?</p>

      <p>This is often a good place to put plants, most plants thrive here.</p>

      <p>Do you utilize your community garden?
        This is a nice way to become more connected within your community.</p>
      <p>This is often a nice way to share outside space without having to plan your own garden. </p>

  <h2>Do you have a favorite plant?</h2>

    <p>Does gardening remind you of someone?</p>

    <p>I often plant things that were my family or friend's favorite flower.  I feel connected to them by growing what they <em>love</em>.  There are different family favorites and it is a good way to start a new family tradition.</p>


    <p>Do you garden with family or by yourself?</p>

    <p>I try to include my son in the gardening and it's often trial and error.  Fun in the sun is our goal.</p>

  There are different harvesting seasons for various fruit trees.  There are gleaning (to gather leftover produce after a harvest) groups on Facebook, or you can check in with your local food bank for information.  Another great way to save money and help yourself and others.

  <p>Look at what the Farmer's Almanac suggests for using up the crisp fall apples.</p>
